The temple was commissioned by King Vishnuvardhana in 1117 AD. Scholars are divided about the reasons for the construction of the temple. The military successes of Vishnuvardhana is considered a probable reason. Some scholars believe Vishnuvardhana commissioned the temple to surpass his overlord, King Vikramaditya VI of the Western Chalukya Empire (who ruled from Basavakalyan), after his initial military victories against the Chalukyas. According to another theory, Vishnuvardhana was celebrating his famous victory against the Chola dynasty of Tamil country in the battle of Talakad (1116 AD), which resulted in the annexation of Gangavadi (modern southern Karnataka) by the Hoysalas. Another theory points to Vishnuvardhana's conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism (a sect of Hinduism) after coming under the influence of saint Ramanujacharya, considering this is a predominantly Vaishnava temple in sculptural iconography.

Shaiva merchants of Halebidu financed the construction of the Hoysaleswara temple to compete with the Chennakesava temple built at Belur, elevating Halebidu to an important city as well. Hoysala temples however were secular and encouraged pilgrims of all Hindu sects, the Kesava temple at Somanathapura being an exception with strictly Vaishnava sculptural depictions.[64] Temples built by rich landlords in rural areas fulfilled fiscal, political, cultural and religious needs of the agrarian communities. Irrespective of patronage, large temples served as establishments that provided employment to hundreds of people of various guilds and professions sustaining local communities as Hindu temples began to take on the shape of wealthy Buddhist monasteries.[65]"

Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is generally depicted standing. He wears rich clothes (generally in sculpture, only a dhoti as well as various ornaments like a crown, armbands, necklaces etc., symbolic of royalty and the yagnopavita (sacred thread).

Sometimes, even three-headed but aspects of Vishnu where the fierce rear head is dropped are considered to represent Vaikuntha Chaturmurti.The presence of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti found in Kashmir and north West India predating 10th century suggests the worship of Vishnu in this form in the era. The form developed a cult between 8th to 10th century CE."
Slightly broken\scul62.jpg,": Vishnu in-style of Changu Narayan,800s,nepal","This print showcases the exquisite artwork of a Vishnu sculpture dating back to the 9th century in Nepal. Crafted in the distinctive style of Changu Narayan, this piece is a true testament to the artistic brilliance of ancient Nepalese craftsmen. Carved meticulously out of schist, this Vishnu sculpture stands at an impressive overall height of 43.8 cm (17 1/4 in. ), making it a remarkable representation of divine beauty and grace. The attention to detail is evident in every aspect, from the intricately carved facial features to the delicate adornments that embellish his attire. Vishnu, one of Hinduism's principal deities, is depicted here with four arms symbolizing his omnipotence and ability to protect humanity. His serene expression exudes tranquility and wisdom, while his elaborate crown signifies his divine status. The significance of this artwork lies not only in its aesthetic appeal but also in its historical value. It offers us a glimpse into Nepal's rich cultural heritage and serves as a reminder of the profound influence religion has had on art throughout history. As we admire this stunning photograph print from Liszt Collection, let us appreciate the skillful craftsmanship that has preserved such treasures for centuries. May it inspire us to delve deeper into our own cultural roots and foster an appreciation for art's power to transcend time and connect us with our past."

Slightly broken\scul64.jpg,"statue is a buff sandstone figure of Salabhanjika,Madhya Pradesh, India","The present statue represents a remarkably defined sandstone figure of a salabhanjika. Salabhanjika refers to beautifully idealized female figures standing beneath, or often intertwined with, a tree. Similar to a yakshi or apsara, salabhanjika are semi-divine celestial spirits commonly carved in sandstone to adorn exterior and interior temple walls across north India. Salabhanjika can be found in various poses, such as dancing, playing a musical instrument, or grooming as in the present example. Symbols of fertility, their feminine features are often highly exaggerated and richly adorned.
Human images have been incorporated into Indian architecture since at least the first century BCE. From the fourth through sixth centuries CE, as sculptural traditions developed under the Gupta Empire, the human form began to take more autonomous, naturalized, and individualist states. With the Gupta Empire spanning widely across the northern Indian subcontinent, artistic production at the time was marked by relative uniformity across vast geographical boundaries. After the downfall of the empire in the sixth century, distinct regional styles arose and by the eighth century regional stylizations had diversified to the point where scholars are able to speculate on a sculpture’s origins. In relation to figures of salabhanjika, apsara and yakshi, this distinction is evident in the female body form; as the temple sites move eastward into Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the center of gravity shifts from weighted hips to expanded breasts, such as the example here.
The celestial female in the present example is postured beneath a mango tree in a languid pose. It is said that the touch of the salabhanjika bears fruit to the tree, representing both earthly fertility and the life-giving force of the divine. The Shilpa Prakasha (""Light on Art""), an Orissan text from the eleventh century, emphasizes that temple walls must be decorated with yakshi and salabhanjika to ensure the temple will be fruitful. Figures with similarly weightless mango canopies are used as bracket figures in the interior of the popular temples at Khajuraho, the capital of the Chandella Empire."
Slightly broken\scul65.jpg,"Lord Harihar, 12th Century CE. Bhopal Museum
","Splits within a religion is nothing new. Pharaoh Akhnatan broke away from the traditional Egyptian religion in ancient Egypt and established his own cult of Ra, the Sun God. In 1st Century CE Buddhism split into two schools : the Hinyana and the Mahayana.  Hinduism is no exception.  In ancient India we had two sects: the Shaivites and the Vaishnavites. Those who believed in Lord Shiva and and those who believed in Lord Vishnu.  Like the Shias and the Sunnis,  these two groups in Hinduism also fought with each other, trying to prove the superiority of one God over the other. 
            But in order to survive as a human race, we have learned to synthesis opposing views. Lord Harihar is a byproduct of the synthesis of Lord Shiva on the left and Lord Vishnu on the right side of the viewer. Hence the trident and the Nandi, the bull on the left and the disc and the conch shell on the right. 
            The debate within Hinduism is also between the aesetic and the householder, between the pure intellect  ( Shiva) and the emotions ( Vishnu), between the one who abandons the society ( Shiva) and one who incarnates to save the society  (Vishnu). But we did not waste too much time trying to annihilate each others' sect. We assimilated. And we have thrived as a 5000 year old civilisation. 
             Perhaps Harihar holds the solution to the problem of ""clashes of the civilisations "". On the one hand we are in the globalisation age, yer there is fight and war all around us. We over - react to every statement;  we fight over the silliest issues only trying to prove that our Gods are superior to theirs. Today the issue posed by Galib, the great Urdu poet is  relevant: 
"" Gar tujh bin nahi koi maauzood/ phir ye hangamma e-Khuda kya hai?"" ( If there is no one but One God, then what is this fight about?). 
             Time has come to revive the concept of synthesis, of peace, of prosperity.  For the path of confrontation leads to total annihilation."

The frontal stance of the Didarganj Yakshi does not distribute her weight equally on both legs; her right knee bends slightly while her weight shifts onto her left leg. Due to this, the posture of the legs gently carries through to an unusual movement in the upper body, as the figure bends her torso slightly forward. The forward movement of the body is naturalistic and demonstrates the skillfulness of the artist of the Didarjang Yakshi in capturing the body’s movement in the stone. She has delicate features, with arched eyebrows, large eyes, visible cheekbones, and small lips; however, her nose is chipped off—this damage may have been caused while she remained undiscovered at the bottom of the River Ganges."

Slightly broken\scul76.jpg,sculpture Durga battling the buffalo demon.,"Imagine the anguish of the gods as the end of their reign neared. A seemingly invincible buffalo demon, Mahishasura, had already conquered the world and seemed poised for victory over the heavens. Could he be stopped? It seemed unlikely — Mahishasura had, after all, received a special gift from the god Brahma — an assurance that the demon could never be killed by man or god.
Just then, when all seemed lost, a great mass of blazing energy began to radiate from the gods. It moved and coalesced until finally, shakti (“force” in sanskrit—a formless energetic entity that is feminine and divine) materialized. She was a sight to behold: beautiful, strong, and riding a fierce lion, she was endowed with the weapons and the power of each of the gods.
The buffalo demon Mahishasura was quite sure that a woman could never defeat him and promptly proposed marriage. Her cool rejection led to battle and in the end, the goddess effortlessly pierced him with a trident, decapitated him, and sent his army scurrying. With the heavens and the world saved, the goddess promised to help the gods and the earth whenever she was needed."
